# MacAdmins 2018 Presentation

These are the example projects I used in my talk "Automating a Great On-boarding Experience" at MacAdmins Conference 2018 at Penn State.

You can find links to all the resources at http://tobiasmorrison.com/2018/07/10/macadmins-2018-presentation-links.html

All projects are posted as-is with no warrantee or guarantee that they will work as expected. Poke around, make changes and test, test, test. If you break things by using anything here, that is on you.
